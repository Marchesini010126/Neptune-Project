# Description

The repo contains script which I used to analyse the Lyman-Alpha radiation emitted from the planet Neptune. The main scope of the project was indeed to analyse the flux density 
in the Lyman-Alpha band (1216 Ã…) which is extracted from a dataset of images withdrawed from the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://archive.stsci.edu/) (HST) archive. Atomic Hydrogen is the 
is the principal source of Ly radiation through aresonant scattering and it also happens to be the most abundant atomic species in our Universe. This implies that it is rather complicated 
to distinguish between the radiation derived directly from the atmosphere of the planet and other sources (Interplanetary Medioum, Sunlight reflected from the Planet A complete introduction on Lyman-Alpha radiation can be obtained for the
[Wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman-alpha_line) page on the topic. 



The flat filed images are stored in the usual FITS format, 
commonly in use for astronomical images.
