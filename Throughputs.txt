  Filter transmission curves were measured on orbit by                  
  dividing a spectrum of a standard observed through the                
  filter by a spectrum of the standard observed through                 
  a wide slit.                                                          

  Corrections are needed to account for (1) light lost                  
  outside the slit and (2) light lost outside the                       
  extraction aperture.                                                  

  (1) Light lost outside the slit:                                      
   The filter transmission curve was multiplied by                      
          the APT table for the slit.                                   

  (2) Light lost outside the extraction box:                            
   The G140L and G230L PCT tables for the 25MAMA                        
          modes were concatenated together, as were the                 
          tables for the 52X2 slit. The correction factor               
          for the filter transmission curves is                         
    pctcorr_fuvnuv = pct(25mama)/pct(52X2)                              


  (A) F25CIII, F25CN182, F25CN270, F25LYA, F25MGII                      

  These are all 25x25 arcsecond apertures. Wavelengths                  
  were determined by linearly interpolating the offsets                 
  from a pair of wavecals that bracketed the observations.              
  The F25LYA, F25CIII, F25CN270, and F25CN182 trans-                    
  missions were calculated by calibrating the spectra                   
  with the 52X2 observation of GD153. The results were                  
  then fit using a low order spline, and the APT and PCT                
  corrections applied.                                                  

  (B) F25QTZ, F25SRF2                                                   

  These filters cover both MAMA bands. The observations                 
  in each band were calibrated using the 52X2 observation               
  of GD153. The resulting transmissions for each filter                 
  were concatenated into one spectrum and then interpol-                
  ated to a monotonic wavelength grid to ease spline                    
  fitting. A low order spline was then fit to the concat-               
  enated spectrum.                                                      

  (C) F25ND3                                                            

  For F25ND3, the same technique was used as in (B),                    
  except the flux calibrated standard star BD+75D325,                   
  CDBS' crrefer$calspec/bd_75d325_fos_003.tab, was used                 
  to calibrate the transmissions.                                       

  Data for the transmission vs. wavelength are from                     
  calibration proposal 7096, observations made in summer                
  1997.

  The _new_ throughput measurements were not made with                  
  any effort to cover the redleak (and blueleak), out-of                
  -nominal-passband, regions of the filters.  Therefore                 
  those wavelength regions from the November, 1997,

  Throughputs for the STIS F28X50LP filter.                             
  -December 1998 update.                                                

  To produce this table, a simple zeropoint shift. the existing table   
  for f28x50lp has been multiplied by 0.766 using the                   
  iraf.stsdas.synphot                                                   
  command                                                               

  calcband("0.766*band(stis,ccd,f28x50lp) / band(stis,ccd,50ccd)")      

  (In fact, the input table was the synphot version of the previous oref
  table where the synphot version resampled the original at 5A          
  intervals.                                                            
  The original table was a winter 1997 delivery to oref of ground       
  measurements identified as 'TIM Model/Manufacture Filter Meas.')      

  The factor of 0.766,  comes from on-orbit measurements of             
  spectrophotometric standards.                                         

  Data from proposals 7656 and 7674 were used.  The 7656 data were      
  recalibrated using the best reference files.  The 7674 data are       
  acquisition images and photometry was done using the raw files.       

  The task apphot.phot was used for the photometry with 5 pixel radius  
  aperture and where possible a larger aperture (59 pixel radius for the
  7656 data but 29 for the 7674 data since it is only a 100x100         
  sub-array). For the sky and background subtraction the annulus was    
  from 60 to 100 pixels radius, except for the 7674 data where it was   
  from radius 25 to 35 pixels for the 5 pixel radius measurements and   
  from 30 to 40 for the 29 pixel radius photometry.                     

  SYNPHOT [band(stis,ccd,f28x50lp)] was used to determine the expected  
  counts.  The end results are summarized below.  The SYNPHOT pre-      
  dictions summarized here and detailed at the bottom  were made using  
  the f28x50lp throughput values prior to the zeropoint correction      
  described here.                                                       

                          MEAN

   F28X50LP      26     0.290         Rms on mean = 0.0077              

  This 0.29 mag is relative to the 59 pixel aperture, and corresponds   
  to the factor of 0.766 mentioned above.                               

  The data are listed below. The SYNPHOT predictions below assume a     
  gain=4, and were adjusted to the on-orbit measured gain=4.11 when     
  determining the mean for the table above.

  F28X50OII Update of December 1998                                     

  This revision adds the out-of-nominal-band throughput                 
  (red leak) and 0-valued endpoints.  The red leak was first            
  added to the synphot version of this table in March/April 1997.       
  That synphot table reported the red leak measurement as               
  coming from a witness sample scanned by the manufacturer.             
  The May, 1997, IDT report of the analysis of the red leak             
  notes that the spike at 6000 angstroms has negligible                 
  transmission. 'It can not be seen in the measured trans-              
  missions sent by Ball; we found it using prelaunch images.            
  It was barely seen in those spectra.'

  Updates to slit throughputs for the slits without filters (converted  
  to an infinite aperture).  The 0.2X0.05ND and 0.3X0.05ND apertures    
  also have revised transmissions, as well as the 31X0.05NDA-C and      
  F25NDQ1-4 filters.                                                    

  The F28X50OIII filter has a sharp decrease in peak throughput (a      
  factor of 2), although the total throughput is unchanged.  This       
  is because the new transmissions (based on in-orbit data) include     
  the star's PSF, while the previous (ground-based) measurement did not;
  the PSF broadens the transmission.

  June 1999 updates                                                     
  .                                                                     
  Revised F25SRF2 Throughput                                            
  .                                                                     
  This update changes this filter's throughput values to 0.94 for       
  wavelengths >3125A, an ~15% increase.  The previous revision of       
  this table used on-orbit G140L+G230L data that produced a similar     
  change for wavelengths <3125A.                                        
  .                                                                     
  The current revision is due to G430L data, o4om01070 and o4om01010,   
  from calibration proposal 7661.  One spectrum is through the SRF2     
  filter, the other through the clear 50CCD aperture.  A linear fit     
  to their ratio matches the previous G230L measure(0.94) in their      
  2940-3125A overlap.  We assume this 0.94 level continues redward      
  of the 5750A endpoint of this G430L data.                             
  .                                                                     
  Indications are this and the previous update do not represent a change
  in the filter throughput.  George Hartig presented transmittance      
  curves, in a Nov96 instrument review, which are consistent with these 
  in-flight data.  Thus, the previous, pre-flight, SRF2 tables with     
  throughput of ~0.8 from redward of ~1500A  were likely inaccurate.    
  .                                                                     
  .                                                                     
  Revised F28X50OIII Througput                                          
  .                                                                     
  The Jan 99 update to this file for the F28X50OIII filter used         
  in-flight data for the transmission which had the PSF convolved with  
  the actual filter throughput.  The PSF should be removed via          
  deconvolution.  The data are unsuitable quality for this, however.    
  A PSF was constructed from observations of HR7615, observation set    
  O49Q02010, proposal ID 7642, by block averaging 7 rows centered on    
  the stellar image.  This was convolved with the vendor's transmission 
  curve (as given in the Dec 1998 file, oref$icb12027o_apt.fits).       
  Comparison of this to the in-flight curve reveals a nearly identical  
  shape (peak, width, area the same) with a 0.28 pixel offset in        
  wavelength.  The offset is plausibly attributable to target acq error.
  The conclusion is that the vendor curve is an accurate representation 
  of the in-flight filter throughput.  Therefore, the throughput as     
  given in the December 1998 delivery was used to replace the values    
  in the January 1999 version of this file, with one minor change:      
  as in the January 1999 version, the red-leak section was extrapolated 
  to 11999 A, and then zeroed out at 12000 A.                           
  .                                                                     
  .                                                                     
  Revised F28X50OII Througput

  This change re-installs the vendor-measured curve that was in         
  the apt file prior to Feb 1999 (see F28X50OIII filter above for       
  more details.

  For those apertures supported for use with the CCD, the correct       
  end wavelength should be 10330A.  For all the 52" slits, the          
  throughput at 10330A has been added by extrapolating from the         
  last 2 points (8800 and 10000).

  25Jun99 F25ND5 THROUGHPUT REVISION                                    

      THE CURRENT DELIVERY uses the UV measures (<3160A) from           
      Cycle 7 CAL/STIS program 8069. The throughput for wavelengths     
      >4000A are the synphot stis_f25nd5_001 table scaled by a          
      factor of 0.79.                                                   

      The HST standard stars that are bright enough to yield F25ND5     
      spectra are too bright to observe in imaging mode.  Therefore     
      in order to arrive at throughput vs wavelength in F25ND5 we       
      bootstrap to the F25ND3 calibration.                              

      Using the net counts from the G140L and G230L spectra of 8069     
      we divide the F25ND5 spectra by the F25ND3.  The resulting        
      G140L and G230L ratios are merged into one spectrum. That         
      spectrum is fit(sigma clip of -2.5 +3.0) with a 7 segment         
      cubic spline . This smooth curve is multiplied by the             
      on-orbit measured F25ND3 throughput that was installed in         
      stis_f25nd3_002.tab.  The result is the UV portion of the         
      present delivery.                                                 

      The optical and near IR end of the 001 ground measures            
      were appended to the above derived UV, but scaled (*.79) so       
      that the countrate predicted using the new curve (and synphot     
      reference spectra listed below) matched the countrate found       
      in aperture photometry of several on-orbit images taken           
      through the F25ND5 filter.  The on-orbit data, also listed        
      below, were measured with iraf.phot and a 5 pixel radius          
      aperture.  The resulting countrates were corrected to             
      'infinite' aperture values by using a factor of 1.2483.           
      That factor was determined from the curve of growth of a          
      deep f28x50lp image, o49q01020.

  Correction - Extension of Throughputs from 10000A to 10330A           

  When the throughputs for the CCD apertures (52") were                 
  previously updated, the number of elements in the array               
  was mistakenly left unchanged.  These have now been                   
  updated to reflect the additional element required to                 
  get to 10330A.

  History for F28X50LP update (June 2001)                               

  Slitless spectroscopy was taken with both 50CCD and F28X50LP and the  
  G430L and G750L gratings as part of program 7661.  The net counts for 
  these spectra were extracted and combined and the count rate through  
  the  F28X50LP filter were divided by the unfiltered countrates and    
  then smoothed interactively in IDL to define the relative filter      
  throughput as a function of wavelength.

  History for NDQ1 and NDQ4 updates.                                    

  Prior on orbit throughput measures were based solely on slitless      
  spectroscopy. The large offset along the dispersion direction of      
  these filters means that wavelengths < 1330 Angstroms fell off the    
  detector when the spectra were taken, and the throughput curves at    
  shorter wavelengths were left undefined.  However, when using these   
  filters for FUV imaging a substantial fraction of the detected counts 
  come from < 1330 Angstroms and neglecting this part of the throughput 
  curve substantially underestimates the true count rate for hot        
  targets.  This update extrapolates the throughput curves for F25NDQ1  
  and F25NDQ4 to shorter wavelengths.  The extrapolation for F25NDQ1    
  was adjusted slightly to give improved agreement between the measured 
  and predicted counts rates for the FUV-MAMA/F25NDQ1 imaging           
  observation O5JA03Y5Q of the hot standard star HS2027+0651.

  A number of new spectroscopic pseudoapertures positions have          
  been defined for STIS. These new positions are 52X0.2E2,              
  52X0.5E2, 52X2E2, 52X0.05D1, 52X0.1D1, 52X0.2D1                       
  52X0.5D1, 52X2D1, 25MAMAD1, F25QTZD1, and F25SRF2D1                   

  The E2 positions are for use the the STIS-CCD and the G750L or        
  G750M. The target is offset in the physical aperture so that it       
  aligns with the 52X0.1 aperture that is used for point source         
  fringe flats near row 900.                                            

  The D1 aperture positions are for G140L and G140M observations        
  of faint targets. They are positioned about 2" above the bottom       
  of the detector to minimize the contribution of the FUV MAMA          
  dark current. 52X0.05D1 and 52X0.1D1 can also be used for CCD         
  peakups.                                                              
  Rows for E2 apertures are based on the existing rows for the          
  corresponding E1 apertures, except that the offset in the             
  dispersion direction is chosen to align with the 52X0.1E1.            
  Rows for D1 apertures are based on the corresponding regular          
  apertures, except the background region is set to +/-30 pixels.       

  Revised throughputs 31X0.05NDA,B, & C; October 03, 2013               

UPDATED January 2014                                                    
Throughput curves have been added for the 31X0.05NDA, 31X0.05NDB, and   
31X0.05NDC apertures.  The data were derived using the upper envelope   
of the throughputs implied by existing observations of reference stars  
with well determined spectra that were observed using these apertures   
prior to October 1, 2013.  OTA breathing can cause substantial          
throughput variations for small apertures, and for bright object        
screening it is necessary to adopt the highest realized throughput.     
Data from the G140L, G140M, G230L, E140H, E140M, E230H, and E230M       
gratings were considered, but in practice the upper envelope of the     
throughput was set by G140L and G230L observations.                     

For 31X0.05NDA and 31X0.05NDB, observations of GD153 from datasets      
O3ZX080Z0 and O2ZX08H9Q taken on 1997-07-13 were the ones that most     
constrained the adopted final adopted throughputs.                      

For 31X0.05NDC the throughput was most constrained by observations of   
HD51038 from datasets O64G07010 and O64G07020 taken on 2001-02-02.      

The process was to choose flux references targets that have a good      
estimate of flux as a function of wavelength.  The existing             
observations of these targets were rereduced using X1D and the Aug 9,   
2013 calibration data.  The existing pipeline throughput values were    
scaled by the ratio of the rereduced flux to the standard star flux to  
derive the implied aperture throughputs.
